# Summary

This paper presents an overview of a blog that was developed as a learning-module for the 3D Slicer (?) architecture and module development for image-guided therapy (IGT) applications. Image-guided therapies are medical procedures that use computer-based systems that provide navigation facilities and supplemental procedure information to help the physician precisely visualize and target the surgical site. This learning-module focuses on the development of 3D Slicer IGT scripted modules. In addition to providing a top to bottom description of 3D Slicer architecture, this blog covers the components required to develope an IGT module in 3D Slicer. These components include (1) the Plus Library, PlusServer (?), a platform for data capture and broadcasting, and (2) the 3D SlicerIGT Extension (?), a platform for receiving the broadcasted data in 3D Slicer for further processing and visualization. This information is presented as an interactive blog in which examples, demonstrations, and sample codes are provided to facilitate implementation of an IGT module for a novice developer.

#_Statement of Need_

There is a pletera of various resources pertaining to 3D Slicer and the PlusToolKit 
Our objective is to bring together and present key concepts in 3D Slicer module development with a focus on image-guided interventions in a simple way. We hope that this blog will reduce the learning curve and eliminate the fear of development with 3D Slicer for beginners.
